            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

                  </opener>
                  <p>SINCE my Laſt, I have ſomewhat to communicate to you, more than what formerly I ſent you: And knowing you to be a Perſon of Truſt and Integrity, and withall deſirous to know how Squares goe, to the Intent you may aſſiſt us in all Lawfull wayes (if oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>caſion preſents) I am willing to give you this farther ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>faction.</p>
                  <p>SIR,<lb/>
Not to Trouble you with Prolixities or a vain Rehearſal of my former Letter: Let me farther acquaint you, That ſince my laſt, Our Royal Captains Son was entertain'd by ſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>veral Perſons (of no ſmall repute or Quality in the Ship) and: that in the great Cabin, with an Extraordinary entertain<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment; To give you a full Relation whereof, thus it was:</p>
                  <p>
                     <pb n="2" facs="tcp:53299:2" rendition="simple:additions"/>
                     <!-- PDF PAGE 32 -->
Upon occaſion of an Extraordinary, or rather Cuſtomary Solemnity (in reſpect it hapneth annually aboard our ſhip) Our Captaines Son was thought fit to be invited to the En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tertainment, which accordingly was done with the mature Deliberation and Advice of the Principal Officers, at whoſe Charge this Cuſtomary Solemnity was to be defrayed: It ſeems our Captains Son was ſo modeſt at the firſt Invitation as to give a refuſal to the ſame, ſhewing them ſeveral reaſons to juſtify his abſence: but being over importuned he came out of his Cabbin <hi>incognito,</hi> to avoid thoſe Acclamations the Marriners were accuſtomed to Salute him withal: but it ſeems his Privacy was diſcovered, and the whole Company rang him ſuch a Peal as he went<g ref="char:punc">▪</g> that he was forced to clap both his Hands on his ears, and deſire them to forbear. This is ſeems is (ſince come to our Lieutenants ears, who though he knows not which way to help himſelf, yet ſtorms like wild but the honeſt Marriners take ſo little Notice of the ſame, that it is e'n indifferent whether he be pacified or not.</p>
                  <p>Sir. The night after this entértainment happened an oc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cational accident worth your ſerious remark: which was this, There was a kind of a buzzing about the Ship, That a certain <hi>Mahometan</hi> a-board had a parcel of Arms in his Cabbin, with which he deſigned to do the Ships company a miſchief, if occa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſion ſerved: but upon notice thereof given to our Captain he iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſued out an expreſs Order to ſearch for the ſame, (as indeed all the Ships company know him to be a perſon extraordinary care<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ful in ſuch Caſes.) The perſon ordered to make ſearch was re<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>puted an honeſt Quarteer; but whither for gain or otherwiſe, I cannot ſay, He had no ſooner received his Order: but contrary to the ſame, gave private notice to him, That next Morning he muſt make a ſtrickt ſearch for Arms, and withal deſired him to conſult his own Intereſt. The <hi>Mahometan</hi> thereupon puts all things out of the way, and deſired him to come as ſoon as he pleaſed, which the next Morning he did, and was gratifyed with a pair of old ruſty Piſtols, which the <hi>Mahometan</hi> pretended had formerly been his Fathers: our Searcher being ſo much a Knave as to take his Word for the reſt. But a more narrow inſpection being made into the buſineſs by an honeſt Marriner, he hath ſince informed our Council of Officers of the ſame (who ſtill fit, pray God they may continue) who have thereupon iſſued forth an ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſs Order to bring the Delinquent before them with all expedi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tion, who doubtleſs will be ſent to keep company with the reſt of his f<gap reason="illegible: missing" extent="1 letter">

                     <hi>Sir.</hi> This Buſineſs appeared with ſo foul a Face, That our Councill of Officers taking particular Notice of this Action, as well as of ſeveral others too tedious here to relate) made theſe ſeveral Propoſals following; Reſolving to ſecond them with their Lives and Fortunes, as themſelves have expreſt; with their utmoſt Integrity and Affection: <hi>viz.</hi>
                  </p>
                  <p>That they will aſſiſt our moſt beloved Royal CAPTAIN, as far as Fortune, Life and Eſtate goes, againſt the <hi>Mahometans,</hi> and that they will teſtify their readineſs and hearty good will upon the firſt Occaſion that offers,</p>
                  <p>That if any <hi>Mahometan, Algerine</hi> or other diſaffected Per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſon ſhould but make an Attempt againſt our CAPTAIN: (tho' without Succeſs) to do him prejudice, as well the Officers as the honeſt Marriners proteſt Solemnly they would not leave a Bone of the <hi>Mahometans</hi> or <hi>Algerines</hi> above board to report their Trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>chery.</p>
                  <p>Nay that which you can hardly believe, and we with Admiration hear; is this (to our unſpeakable joy and Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fort be it ſpoken) That our Lieutenant ſhall be diſabled from ever bearing a Captaines Command a-board this Ship; thus much as to our own Ship.</p>
                  <p>The <hi>Lyon Rampant</hi> (where our Lieutenant is a-Board) ſeems to be weary of their Officer, though they dare not ſcarce ſay ſo; yet by ſeveral Paſſages betwixt them and us we are apt to believe it. The Truth of it is, The Ship is a good Ship, pray God grant her as good Officers: as for the Captains Care it is beyond meaſure circumſpect: Without doubt were our Lieute<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nant a man as careful for the Ships Good and Intereſt; the Sailors would not complain as now they doe.</p>

                  <p>IN my laſt I gave you a ſmall Account of the <hi>Golden Harp</hi> (now in company with us) to ſay the Truth, I verily believe the <hi>Algerines</hi> deſigned firſt to lay her a-board by ſeveral Con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jectures that I have not thought fit here to be mentioned: but

let me tell you I know this from my own Experience, as well as from the Relation of ſeveral of our Officers a-board. That nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther the <hi>Mahometan</hi> nor <hi>Algerine</hi> can do us the leaſt Dammage unleſs our Council of Officers diſagree (which God forbid) as yet they are unanimous, and for ought I know will continue ſo: Out Captain reſolving to dye in our Quarrel rather than ſubmit one Tittle to theſe <hi>Mahumetans,</hi> encourages us beyond Expreſſion: And if the Ships Company do not ſtand by Him with their Lives and Eſtates never believe man more for my ſake:</p>
                  <p>In a Word, The CAPTAIN, is ſo well belov'd on Board, 'Tis impoſſible for me to expreſs it, unleſs I ſhould write it in Characters with my Heart-blood: which I am ready now to do for our CAPTAIN and his Ships Company.</p>
